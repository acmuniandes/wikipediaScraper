# wikipediaScraper

A *recursive* scraper that searches through wikipedia links starting from wikipedia.com/Github .
The scraper collects all the links inside a wikipedia page, selects one randomly and explores the new page.
Finally, the scraper stores the data in a .json file and a javascript library (D3.js) shows the result
